## Introduction

### Overview

HBV model is a traditional hydrologic model developed in 1972 to predict area runoff/discharge based on most basic elements. It is still currently used in some areas as a tool that convert meteorological observation
into discharge[^1]. And this is a simplified implementation by C++ based on the content of McMaster University CIVENG 6M03 class's lab. This program can build HBV model easily with given dataset and parameters, then generate the data file with NSE value.

### Implementation

There are 5 parts in building an HBV model. The flow chart of core components of implementing HBV model is shown in figure below:

![logic](logic.png)

#### Snowmelt and Accumulation

The snowmelt and accumulation of snow are relied on the threshold temperature in that area. And the equation for calculating the snowmelt rate( $mm/day$ ) is shown in the equation below:

$$
S_m(t)=DDF(T(t)-T_tr)
$$

DDF is the degree-day factor( $mm/(^\circ C*day)$ ) and T is daily mean temperature.

#### Effective Precipitation

With the snowmelt rate, we can determine the effective precipitation. The precipitation can be rain or snow, and we can use threshold temperature to determine the snow or rain. If that's snow, we can use snowmelt rate to determine actual snow rate. If not, we can determine the effective precipitation.
The equation of water flux(F) to ground water is shown as the equation below:

$$
F(t)=\frac{SM(t-1)}{FC}^\beta (P(t)+ASM(t))
$$

 SM is actual soil moisture(mm), FC is field capacity(mm), ASM is the actual snow melt(mm) in that day and $\beta$ is a parameters that limit water to ground water recharge.

#### Evapotranspiration

Actual Evapotranspiration(ACT) is based on potential evapotranspiration( $ET_0$ ). $ET_0$ can be calculated as the equation below:

$$
ET_0(t)=\alpha T(t)\quad T(t)\geqslant 0 \quad or \quad 0 \quad otherwise
$$

And $AET$ can be calculated as the equation below:

$$
AET(t)=ET_0(t)*min(\frac{SM(t-1)}{FC*LP},1)
$$

$\alpha$ is a parameters of function of day air temperature, LC is the ratio that determine fraction of FC.

#### Storage and Runoff

The calculation of SM is shown as the equation below:

$$
SM(t)=SM(t-1)+P(t)+S_m(t)-AET(t)-F(t)
$$

Runoff is the sum of $Q_0$ (discharge in near surface flow), $Q_1$ (discharge in upper reservoir), $Q_2$ (discharge in lower reservoir) and the equation of them are below:

$$
Q_0(t)=k_0(SUZ(t-1)-L_{suz}) \quad or\quad 0 \quad otherwise
$$

$$
Q_1(t)=k_1 SUZ(t-1)
$$

$$
Q_2(t)=k_2 SLZ(t-1)
$$

$k_0$, $k_1$ and $k_2$ are the coefficients in each level.  $L_{SUZ}$ is the threshold parameters of interflow.  Storage is the sum of SUZ(the amount of water stored in the upper reservoir) and LUZ(Groundwater in the lower reservoir) and the equations of them are below:

$$
SUZ(t)=SUZ(t-1)+F(t)-Q_0(t)-Q_1(t)-C_{perc}
$$

$$
SLZ(t)=SLZ(t-1)+C_{perc}-Q_2(t)
$$

$C_{perc}$(mm/d) is the constant percolation rate at the upper reservoir.

#### NSE

To evaluate the performance of our model, we can use Nashâ€“Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient value. The NSE value can be calculated as:

$$
NSE=1-\frac{\sum_{n = 1}^{N}  (Q_{observed}-Q_{prediction})^2}{\sum_{n = 1}^{N}  (Q_{observed}-\overline{Q_{observed}})^2 }
$$

N means the number of data, and $Q_{observed}$ means the discharge we got from the dataset, and $Q_{prediction}$ means the discharge calculated by model. The closer the value of NSE to 1 means the better performance of the model.

## Getting Start

This program is developed and tested on the x64 windows device with C++20 and it should compile on any device with C++20. In order to start the program, please download the whole program folder.

### Program

#### Overview Information

To get overview information, you just need to run the exe on the console.

```{text}
./hbv
```

or

```{text}
hbv
```

This command will return overview information of this program including quick start and command.

#### Documentation

Argument "--help" or "-h" will return introduction on how to use this program. You can start like:

```{text}
hbv -h
```

or

```{text}
hbv --help
```

##### Run with Example Data

The program folder also contains the example data called "example_data.csv" and the parameters example file called "parameters.txt". To run example of this program, you could do as what's shown below:

```text
hbv -e
```

or

```text
hbv --example
```

It will output NSE value and output "result.csv" under the program folder.

#### Start Your Own HBV model

To start your own hbv model, you need to prepare a data file like "example_data.csv" and a parameters file like "parameters.txt". Detailed information about those two file can be found in next section. Please run commend like this:

```text
hbv "data file path" "parameters file path" "output path"
```

"data file path" is where your data file is located and "parameters file path" is where your parameters file is located. "output path" is the final result file output path.
Here is an example to build a HBV model:

```text
hbv example_data.csv parameters.txt result.csv
```

#### Modify the program

The program contain several methods.

##### Print Overview of Program

To print overview of the program, you could simply call:

```c++
print_overview();
```

##### Print Help Information

To print help information of the program, you could call:

```c++
print_help_message();
```

##### Run HBV model

To build hbv model, you could call:

```c++
runHBV(data_file, parameters_file, output_path)
```

Data_file, parameters_file, output_path are all strings and they store the path of the data file, parameters file and output file. This method can handle normal IO exception and contain missing values as well as non-double values detection for the data file. And it could handle if exist unexpected input from the parameters file.

### hbv_model.hpp

This project included hbv_model.hpp file that you could make modifications for your project or program.

#### Included in your program

To included hbv_model.hpp to your program:

```c++
#include "hbv_model.hpp"
```

#### Constructor

The library included one constructor that can build the HBV model and call all the function for calculations as shown below:

```c++
hbv_model hbv_model(Q, P, T, parameters);
```

Q, P, T, and parameters are all double vectors. Q is the observe discharge/run off for each day. P is the precipitation for each day and T is daily mean temperature each day. Parameters are the vector that included all the parameters. Q, P, T should have same size and parameters should follow the order below:

```c++
T_tr = parameters[0];
DF = parameters[1];
FC = parameters[2];
beta = parameters[3];
alpha = parameters[4];
LP = parameters[5];
k0 = parameters[6];
k1 = parameters[7];
k2 = parameters[8];
Lsuz = parameters[9];
Cperc = parameters[10];
SD_i = parameters[11];
SUZ_i = parameters[12];
SLZ_i = parameters[13];
SM_i = parameters[14];
A = parameters[15];
```

The constructor will perform all the calculation after setting up the value.

#### Getting Result of HBV model

This library provides multiple methods to get the result of the HBV model.

To get NSE value, you can just do like this:

```c++
hbv_model.getNSE();
```

To get the vector that contained effective rainfall(RF) information for each day, you can do:

```c++
hbv_model.getRF();
```

To get the vector that contained potential evapotranspiration (ET)information for each day, you can do:

```c++
hbv_model.getET();
```

To get the vector that contained actual evapotranspiration (AET) information for each day, you can do:

```c++
hbv_model.getAET();
```

To get the vector that contained the amount of water stored in the upper reservoir(SUZ) information for each day, you can do:

```c++
hbv_model.getSUZ();
```

To get the vector that contained the amount of water stored in the lower reservoir information for each day, you can do:

```c++
hbv_model.getSLZ();
```

To get the vector that contained the discharge for each day, you can do:

```c++
hbv_model.getQt();
```

To get the vector that contained the discharge in that area for each day, you can do:

```c++
hbv_model.getQa();
```

#### Get Suggestion Based on NSE

Since NSE is an important value evaluate performance of HBV model. You could get some suggestion by calling method:

```c++
hbv_model.getNSE_AD();
```

#### Calculate Average value of Observe Q (Private Function)

This library provides a function that can calculate average value of observe Q. If you want to re-use it, just simply do as this in the library:

```c++
getAverageQ();
```

#### Set Parameters (Private Function)

This library provided a function that can set parameters by given vector. If you want to develop more functions by re-using this method, please perform the function as below:

```c++
setParameter();
```

#### Check Range of Parameters(Private Function)

This library provided a function that check the range of each parameter. The range of each parameter is followed by the table:
|No|Parameters|Lower bound| Upper bound
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|   1 | T_tr | -1.5 | 2.5 |
|   2 | DF | 1 | 10 |
|   3 | FC | 50 |500|
|   4 | beta | 1| 6|
|   5 | alpha | 0.5 | 1.25|
|   6 | LP | 0.1| 0.9|
|   7 | k0 | 0.01 | 0.8|
|   8 | k1 | 0.01 | 0.4|
|   9 | k2 | 0.001 | 0.15|
|  10 | Lsuz| 1| 100|
|  11 | Cperc | 0.01 |6|

The function will check if the value is in range. If not it will set the value to the lower bound value. If you want to call them in the library, just like:

```c++
checkRange();
```

#### Check value inbound (Private Function)

This library provided a function that can check a value if it's between two value. If you want to made modify to the library, feel free to use it:

```c++
inRange(value, low, high);
```

"value" is the value you want to check, and "low" and "high" are the value as lower bound and higher bound.

#### Calculate HBV model (Private Function)

This library provided a function that do run the HBV model based on the given data. If you want to re-use it, just called like this in the library:

```c++
getResult();
```

## Input File

The program usually required two file as input file: the data file and the parameters file.

### Data File

The data file should be CSV file or in the same format. It should have at least 3 columns that stores data on temperature, precipitation, and discharge. It could have a header or the data start at line 2. And It should have more than two units(times) records for calculations. Example file "example_data.csv" can be a good example as a reference.

## Example Output

The output of the example is shown as follows:

```text
HBV model build successful!                                                                                                             
Data file generated as result.csv

The NSE value is 0.875398

NSE is a value to evaluate performance of model.A value closer to 1 mean better performance
on the model just like R^2

  Suggestion:
The result seems good.
```

It also generated a "report.csv" file.
**Note: The value of NSE and data in generated file will keep 3 digits after decimal point**
